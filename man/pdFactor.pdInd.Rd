\title{Factor of a pdInd object.}
\usage{
\method{pdFactor}{pdInd}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{a 'pdInd' object from which the right-triangular factor of the variance matrix it represents will be extracted}
}
\value{
the full right-triangular factor, including zeros in the lower triangle, is returned as a vector in column order
}
\description{
Function to compute the upper triangular factor of a pdInd object representing the factorization of the inverse variance matrix.
}
\details{
Returns a factor for a right log-Cholesky object for positive-definite inverse variance matrix corresponding to a variance matrix with zero covariances except in the first row and column. i.e.
$$
V^{-1} = R'R
$$
with $R$ a right-triangular matrix.

Then if the upper-diagonal elements of $R$ below the first row are all 0 then the corresponding variance matrix with will have zero covariances except on the first row (and column).

mat <- pdInd(diag(1:4))
pdFactor(mat)
