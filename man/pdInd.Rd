\title{Constuctor for Positive-Definite Matrix With Zero Covariances Between Predictor Random Effects}
\usage{
pdInd(value = numeric(0), form = NULL, nam = NULL, data = sys.parent(),
  cov = NULL, zero = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{value}{an option initialization value, which can be any of the
following ...}

\item{form}{an optional one-sided linear formula specifying
the row/column names for the matrix represented by \code{object}.}

\item{nam}{and optional vector of character strings specifying
the row/column names for the matrix represented by \code{object}.}

\item{data}{and optional data frame i which to evaluate
the variables names in \code{value} and \code{form}. ...}

\item{cov}{optional position in lower triangle of
covariances that are estimated and, thus, possibly non-zero.
The default is that the covariances in the first column
are estimated and possibly non-zero.}

\item{zero}{optional way of specifying covariances constrained
to be equal to zero. Only the lower triangular portion of
the \code{zero} is used. The elements that are equal to 0
corresponds to the pattern of elements that are constrained
to zero in the covariance matrix.}
}
\description{
This function is a constructor for the \code{pdInd} class, representing a positive-definite matrix with zero covariances except possibly in the first row and column. If the matrix associated with \code{object} is of dimension $n$, it is represented by $n + (n-1)$ unrestricted parameters representing a lower-triangular log-Cholesky decomposition. The first $n$ parameters are the logs of the diagonal elements of the matrix and the last $n-1$ components are the $n-1$ remaining elements of the lower-triangular decomposition corresponding the to the possibly non-zero covariances in the first row.

cov and zero do not work.
